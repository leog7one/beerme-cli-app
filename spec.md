# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application
	created a CLI using dummy info to make sure the app worked at first. Once the app was able to run using the dummy info, I went to scraping the ratebeer.com site using nokogiri
- [x] Pull data from an external source
	Data pulled from RateBeer.com using nokogiri, data is updated daily as new beers get reviewed. This data refreshes back to nothing every month so it may be empty for the first few days of every month
- [X] Implement both list and detail views
	The list view for the beers was generated by iterating through the table rows of all the beers and grabbing the name using array[i] as there were 5 items per each row and the name was item 1.
